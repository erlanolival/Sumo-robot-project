# Sumo-robot-project

#Description
Project of an autonomous sumo robot using ultrasound sensor for detecting the enemy and reflective optical sensor to detect
the edge of the arena. For controlling the robot, it was used the PIC 16F628A.

Ultrasound Sensor: HC-SR04
Reflective Optical Sensor: QRE1113GR

Two ultrasound sensors were used. One on the right side, and the other one on the left side.
Two reflective optical sensors were used. One on the right side, and the other one on the left side.

HC-SR04 module has 4 pins :

* VCC – 5V, +ive of the power supply
* TRIG – Trigger Pin
* ECHO – Echo Pin
* GND – -ive of the power supply
